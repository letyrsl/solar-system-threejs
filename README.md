# ‚òÑÔ∏èüî≠ Solar System in ThreeJS
This GitHub project utilizes Three.js to create a straightforward and visually engaging animation of the solar system.

This scene includes all the planets within our solar system orbiting the sun.

Each planet undergoes a graceful orbital translation around the sun while also spinning on its axis.
The sun radiates light from its core through a Pointlight, casting shadows on the planets.

Notably, the Earth hosts a satellite in its orbit.

Moreover, a user-friendly GUI allows you to control the speed of the orbital animation.
Enjoy exploring this celestial dance!
